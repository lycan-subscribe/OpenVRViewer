## Instructions

Import this as a project with [unity 2019.4.31f1](unityhub://2019.4.31f1/bd5abf232a62) and the 3D pipeline (HDRP/URP coming soon?) - ignore the namespace errors

Use the asset store to download the SteamVR package first, use legacy VR, follow the prompts to install openVR as well and change all recommended settings, then cross your fingers

Also remember to `git clone --recurse-submodules`

To get it working optimally with all scenes, the following packages are recommended:
- TextMesh Pro Essentials
- Dynamic Bones
